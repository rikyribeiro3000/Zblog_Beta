# Zblog_Beta


Originally was one of my course work, and I decided to take it and add as much features as I can, So it can be a showcase and live example on integration of multiple features in one application.


This Application is Open Source, feel free to use it whatever way you want. I made it so that it can be a live reference full of features.
---------------------
# What did I add:
 * Authentication Using PassportJS: User Login/Signup/Logout.
 * Blog post Authentication: User Can't edit/delete/post or comment unless User is loggedin.
 * Dynamic Navbar changes based on User's Loging Status.
 * Comment System_Beta
 * Full Styling
 
# What I am Planning to add or improve:
  * Global Chat system for all users
  * User Profile
  * Authentication using more PassportJs Strategies
  * More Security Features
  * Post Rating (like, Dislike system)
  * More Pages for different redirects (login failed, Username Is already in use)
 
 
# Bugs that need to be fixed:
* Comment's data to be Dynamic instead of hard code
